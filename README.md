:collision: This repo was abrted because we decide to move all "the program" on the repo from Paolo"

#Calculette

This is our project in **C#** to understand the concept of **object programming**.
The purpose of this program is to be with a main project with .exe output and a second project with a lot of tiny .dll ouputs that are used to make our different function.

:collision:The rest are old project....

#Instru to create "The Program"
- We have to create **two project** but they have to be in the same solution so we create the project *Calcul_main* as a *ConsoleApplication* and the *Calcul_lib* as a *biblihotèque de classe* **inside the same solution**
- :collision:!When we create a new project it's in a new solution each time so we have to create the second one inside the first solution!

#Instru .gitignore

\***/ est necessaire pour indiquer qu'il faut ignorer tout les directory ahead à partit de **Git 8**

Ne pas ignorer les properties car dedans s'y trouve le fichier assembly.cs qui est necessaire pour faire tourner le programme.

##First Choice
:collision: Attention please! If you write anything other than the expected numbers it will show an exception and reload the propositions.

if you chose the *1)* you'll be asked to choose a student.
:collision: You need to write his name correctly and entirely in order the program to work ;)

If the student is not recognized, the program will say that there is "No such person"

If the student is recognized, it will display his complete name with all his courses,
the number of ects of the courses, the evaluation for each activity and the final average.

If the student has not yet any evaluation, the program will say it.

After that you can consult another student or write "exit" to return at the main menu.


##Second Choice
if you chose the *2)* you'll be proposed to choose an activity.
Write the name of the activity and it will display the students who are attending this lecture.

##Third Choice
if you chose the *3)* you'll be proposed to choose an activity.
Write the name of the chosen activity and it will display the average of all the students
who are attending this lecture.

##Fourth Choice
if you chose the *4)* you'll be proposed to chose again between
- 1)Teachers
- 2)Students
- 3)Activities
- 4)Exit

and it will display the different contents of the correspondant *.csv file*

##Fifth Choice
if you chose the *6)* you receive a perfect ASCII guy who doesn't know a thing!


##Sixth Choice
if you chose the *5)* you'll exit the program.
